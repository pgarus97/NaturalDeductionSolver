# NaturalDeductionSolver

This is an interactive solver for natural deduction proofs in propositional and
first-order logic. The software focuses on digitizing
the process of writing and evaluating natural deduction proofs while being easy to
use and visually appealing in terms of resembling well handwritten proofs. These
are a few of the main differences to other already existing proof solvers, as they
are mostly addressed towards experienced logicians and need an extensive time to
be properly understood and used. The purpose of this proof solver is to be an
educational assistance for beginners and students in logic.
